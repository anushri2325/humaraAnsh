## Why MeraAnsh?
### Issues in Maternal Care in India

Upper- and middle-class women in metropolitan areas spend thousands of rupees at private nursing homes. These women would not venture to the government hospitals in the city, where, at times, two mothers with newborns must share a single bed. These and other scenarios illustrate the lopsided nature of maternal care in India, where maternity-related complications are leading causes of death and disability among women of reproductive age. <br>

 In this country of roughly 1 billion people, where women have, on average, about three children, some **440 women die of maternity-related complications for every 100,000 live births.** The United Nations estimates that at current levels of fertility and mortality, **one out of every 55 women in India faces the risk of maternal death.** <br> 
 
A large proportion of women still **do not receive antenatal checkups, even though such care can detect and treat existing problems and complications, provide counseling on symptoms of problems, help the woman prepare for birth, and advise her on where to seek care if complications arise.** <br>

The situation is **worse in rural areas.** The study painted an even gloomier picture in the rural state’s districts. **Women who did seek care tended to do so only in the second trimester of their pregnancy mainly to confirm that they were indeed pregnant.** <br>

 ### Lack of knowledge of antenatal care, as well as *long distances to health centers and lack of transportation*, were additional reasons given for not seeking care during pregnancy.
 
Checkups for mother and child in the two months after birth are also seen as important by health care professionals, particularly when deliveries do not take place in a health facility. The majority of maternal deaths take place after delivery, most of them within 24 hours after childbirth. Postpartum care allows health workers to detect and manage problems and to make sure mother and child are doing well.
